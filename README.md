# OpenAI_APP_MCP

OpenAI APP MCP POC featuring **Skyward Rewards**, a sample travel experience that mirrors
the structure of the Pizzazz example from the OpenAI Apps SDK repository.

- `travel-app/app`: React + TypeScript UI that highlights reward flight offers with cash
  and points prices.
- `travel-app/mcp`: Python-only MCP server that exposes flight data via structured tools.

Consult `travel-app/README.md` for setup instructions.
